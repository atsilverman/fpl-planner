# FPL Data Audit Report: 2024/25 vs 2025/26

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Player ID Mismatch**
- **2024/25**: Player ID 1 = F√°bio Vieira (Arsenal)
- **2025/26**: Player ID 1 = Raya (Arsenal)
- **Problem**: Player IDs are completely different between seasons!

### 2. **Team ID Changes**
- **Chelsea**: 6 ‚Üí 7
- **Crystal Palace**: 7 ‚Üí 8  
- **Everton**: 8 ‚Üí 9
- **Fulham**: 9 ‚Üí 10
- **Problem**: Team IDs shifted due to promoted/relegated teams

### 3. **Player Name Inconsistencies**
- **2024/25**: "F√°bio Vieira" vs **2025/26**: "Raya"
- **Problem**: Same player ID, completely different players

## üìä CURRENT DATA SOURCES

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly:
- **Player List**: 2025/26 data (current season)
- **Teams**: 2025/26 data (current season)
- **Fixtures**: 2025/26 data (current season)

### ‚ùå Broken:
- **Historical Data**: 2024/25 data with wrong mappings
- **Player Names**: Don't match between seasons
- **Team IDs**: Don't align between seasons

## üîß REQUIRED FIXES

### Option 1: Rebuild Historical Data (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Use team codes** (not IDs) for mapping
2. **Use player names** (not IDs) for mapping
3. **Reprocess historical data** with correct mappings
4. **Update API** to use name-based lookups

### Option 2: Fix Current Mappings (COMPLEX)
1. **Create player ID mapping** using names
2. **Create team ID mapping** using codes
3. **Update API** to handle both mappings
4. **Risk**: Still fragile to future changes

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

**Rebuild the historical data processing** with these principles:
- Use **team codes** (stable) instead of team IDs (unstable)
- Use **player names** (stable) instead of player IDs (unstable)
- Process historical data with current season's team/player structure
- Store data indexed by current season names/IDs

This will be more robust and handle future season changes better.
